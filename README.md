# switch-network-interfaces-script

In my workflow I need to frequently switch between two networks.
And to do so, I was manually disabling and enabling network interfaces, which was tedious process.

The process looked something like: 

- Disable WIFI
- Enable Ethernet 

Do some work 

Then
- Disable Ethernet 
- Enable WIFI

Do some work 
Then repeat.

So I made this script to: switch between networks on a single click of a mouse button (X1 or X2).


## Notes:
- The script is still a WIP


## Resources:
I made this script with the help of these great resources
